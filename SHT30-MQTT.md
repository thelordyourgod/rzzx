To read the temperature from an SHT30 sensor and publish it to an MQTT broker using an ESP32 and MicroPython, follow these steps:

1. Connect the SHT30 sensor to the ESP32:

   - VCC: Connect to 3.3V on the ESP32
   - GND: Connect to GND on the ESP32
   - SDA: Connect to the SDA pin of the ESP32's I2C interface (e.g., GPIO21)
   - SCL: Connect to the SCL pin of the ESP32's I2C interface (e.g., GPIO22)

2. Install the MicroPython SHT30 driver by Rui Santos. You can find the driver here: https://github.com/RuiSantosdotme/ESP-MicroPython/blob/master/code/WiFi/SHT30/sht30.py

3. Upload the driver to your ESP32 using a tool like ampy or rshell.

4. Install the `umqtt.simple` library if it's not already available in your MicroPython firmware. You can find the library here: https://github.com/micropython/micropython-lib/tree/master/umqtt.simple/umqtt

5. Upload the `umqtt` library to your ESP32.

6. Write a MicroPython script to read the temperature, connect to the MQTT broker, and publish the data:

```python
import time
from machine import I2C, Pin
from sht30 import SHT30
from umqtt.simple import MQTTClient

# WiFi and MQTT settings
WIFI_SSID = "your_wifi_ssid"
WIFI_PASSWORD = "your_wifi_password"
MQTT_BROKER = "your_mqtt_broker_address"
MQTT_TOPIC = "your_mqtt_topic"

# Connect to Wi-Fi
import network
wlan = network.WLAN(network.STA_IF)
wlan.active(True)
if not wlan.isconnected():
    print("Connecting to Wi-Fi...")
    wlan.connect(WIFI_SSID, WIFI_PASSWORD)
    while not wlan.isconnected():
        pass
print("Wi-Fi connected")

# Initialize the I2C interface and the SHT30 sensor
i2c = I2C(sda=Pin(21), scl=Pin(22))
sht30 = SHT30(i2c)

# Connect to the MQTT broker
client = MQTTClient("ESP32_SHT30", MQTT_BROKER)
client.connect()
print("Connected to MQTT broker")

# Main loop
while True:
    # Read the temperature and humidity from the SHT30 sensor
    temperature, humidity = sht30.measure()

    # Publish the temperature to the MQTT broker
    client.publish(MQTT_TOPIC, "Temperature: {:.2f} Â°C".format(temperature))

    # Wait before reading and publishing again
    time.sleep(10)
```

7. Replace `your_wifi_ssid`, `your_wifi_password`, `your_mqtt_broker_address`, and `your_mqtt_topic` with the appropriate values for your Wi-Fi network and MQTT broker.

8. Flash the MicroPython script onto the ESP32 and observe the output.

The script will connect to the Wi-Fi network, read the temperature from the SHT30 sensor, and publish it to the specified MQTT topic every 10 seconds. You can modify the script to suit your application requirements, such as changing the publishing interval or adding more sensor data.

You can subscribe to the MQTT topic using an MQTT client or another device to receive and process the temperature data.
